CODE2040 API Challenge
=====
As part of my fellowship application to CODE2040 for the upcoming summer, I completed their API challenge in order to fulfill my application. There were a series of 4 stages which required communicating with their API and manipulating data.

##Implementation
I used Python for several reasons, but mainly because its status as a rapid prototyping language helped me "move fast and break things" throughout the stages, which assisted in debugging. The algorithmic legwork increased from simplistic to difficult, but luckily "Google-Fu" and language libraries were encouraged, which I utilized throughout the challenge. Once I was able to confirm the algorithms worked, I went about creating some API methods to de-clutter the files with cleaner calls to the API.

###Next Steps
Although the initial commit was the state it was received in before the deadline, for personal interests my next steps are to implement a user interface for the python scripts, and further along to implement them in other languages.
